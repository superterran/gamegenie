# Game Genie Code Lookup

This uses Hugo to produce a statically-generated website, that uses a csv to provide a look-up service for game genie codes, that can be hosted on github pages. 

Code is a little sloppy, this was produced very quickly on a lark as game genie look-ups on my phone seemed painful and it shouldn't need much of an interface.

## Features
- added nosleep.js to prevent screen locking
- added meta info required so it can double as homescreen app

## Running Locally

```bash
hugo server --watch
```

## Attribution
