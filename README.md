# Game Genie Code Lookup

This uses Hugo produces a statically-generated website, that uses a csv to provide a look-up form for game genie codes, that can hosted on github pages. 

Code is a little sloppy, this was produced very quickly on a lark as game genie look-ups on my phone seemed painful and it shouldn't need much of an interface.

## Running Locally

```bash
hugo server --watch -D
```
